# Rianú 

This project is called `rianú`, the Irish Language word for tracking. 

Rianú is an open source software, released under the BSD 3-Clause License, designed to more efficiently track engineered cardiac tissues. Further information on installation, setup, and customization please visit [rianu.mrph.dev](https://rianu.mrph.dev).
